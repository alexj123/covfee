# Instructions

These are the instructions for annotating the laughing action in the audio with a controller, you can click the **space** key to play or pause the audio.

Below are the steps to annotate the video clips:
1. Press the space button to start the video clip
2. When you think the laughing action starts, press the **trigger** on the game controller and hold it until you think the laughing action is over. With the trigger you can show the intensity of the laughter, however do not be afraid to fully press the trigger. If you feel like you are too late when you are presing the trigger, we recommend to still press the trigger to the intensity of the laughter, instead of immediately realising it.
