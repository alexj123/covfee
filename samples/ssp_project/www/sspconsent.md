# Delft University of Technology HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS INFORMED CONSENT 

1. You are being invited to participate in a research study titled Understanding Annotation Delay Patterns in Social Actions. This study is being done by **Alex Jeleniewski, Varun Singh, Xin Wan** and their superviors **Jose Vargas Quiros and Hayley Hung** from the Seminar Social Signal Processing course of the TU Delft.

1. The purpose of this research study is to finding the annnotation delay patterns by analysing and comparing the annotating results between using the traditional way(mouse/keyboard) and gamified way(game controller), and will take you approximately 10 minutes to complete. The data will be used for conducting the research and completing our research project. We will be asking you to watch some short videos including human social communications and then using either the game controller or keyboard to annotate the laughing action in the videos. After finishing the annotating, you will also be asked with some post-questions related to the whole process of the experiment as well as your previous experience with these annotation tools.

1. As with any online activity the risk of a breach is always possible. To the best of our ability your answers in this study will remain confidential. We will minimize any risks by making the whole experiment completely anonymous, and not collecting any kind of personal information as well as your identity. We will only store the annotation and post-question results that you complete in the experiment for the purpose of analysis. This contains the intensity of the trigger using the game controller, the time you start and end to press the trigger of the game controller, the event triggered using your mouse or keyboard and the time you start and end to press the key of the keyboard. These data are only be recorded when you are annotating during the experiment and will not be recorded afterwards.

1. Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time during the experiment by closing the webpage. The incompleted data will be automatically deleted.

2. The withdrawal after completion of the experiment is possible by sending the email to one of the contacts list below.
